# Calendar Component running on Storybook
## Installation 
<sub>*ohgodohfuck*</sub>
Trying to replicate my own work has become so confusing I'm no longer sure how it's running on my machine
The important files are:
* chatty-calendar/src/exampleEvent.json
	* JSON of the hardcoded mock event data
* chatty-calendar/src/MyCalendar.js
	* The actual React component
* stories/MyCalendar.stories.js
	* The story for the Calendar Component
